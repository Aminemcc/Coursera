Exercise Description<br>
Fashion MNIST Classifier<br>
In this week's exercise, you will try to build and train a neural network that can classify the images in the Fashion MNIST dataset.  You can use Brackets to open the C1_W2_Assignment.js file and take a look at the code. You can find the C1_W2_Assignment.js file in the following folder in the GitHub repository for this course:

[tensorflow-2-public/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W2/assignment/](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W2/assignment)


Follow the instructions in the next section to complete the exercise. Once you have filled-in the missing code, run the fashion-mnist.html file in the Chrome browser using the Web Server. When you launch the fashion-mnist.html file, tfjs-vis will automatically display the model architecture and the training progress. Once training has finished, you can draw any of the 10 articles of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset on the black rectangle to be classified. After drawing an article of clothing, and pressing the "classify" button, the code will alert the predicted article of clothing. Below are some examples:

1. In this example, the predicted article of clothing is a Bag.
