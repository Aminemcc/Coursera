MNIST Classifier<br>
In the next example, we will create a neural network that can classify the images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. You can use Brackets to open the script.js file and take a look at the code. You can find the script.js file in the following folder in the GitHub repository for this course:

[tensorflow-2-public/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W2/ungraded_lab/](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W2/ungraded_lab)


When you launch the C1_W2_Lab_1_mnist.html file in the Chrome browser (using the Web Server), tfjs-vis will automatically display the model architecture and the training progress. Once training has finished, you can draw digits on the black rectangle to be classified. After drawing a digit, and pressing the "classify" button, the code will alert the predicted digit. As you can see below, in this particular example, the predicted digit is a 4.
