Downloading the Ungraded Labs and Programming Assignments

Like we mentioned earlier, in this course you will be running all the coding examples and exercises locally on your machine. We have created this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public) where you can find all the ungraded labs and programming assignments not only for this course but for the entire TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization. 

You can download all the ungraded labs and programming assignments to your computer by cloning or downloading the GitHub Repository.
