Getting Your System Ready
In this course you will be running all the examples and exercises locally on your machine. Consequently, you will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine. Throughout this course we are going to use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as our internet browser,  [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) as our HTML editor and the [Web Server for Chrome App](http://brackets.io/) as our web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Below, we will go over the installation process of each of these. Of course, you are welcome to use any software that you like, but we recommend that you install the above so that it is easier for you to follow along.
