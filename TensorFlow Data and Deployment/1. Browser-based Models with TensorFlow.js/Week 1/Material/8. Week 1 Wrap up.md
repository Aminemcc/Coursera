Week 1 Wrap up<br>
This week you got an introduction to Machine Learning in the browser with TensorFlow.js. You saw how to build your first basic model -- an iris classifier -- by reading data from a CSV, one hot encoding the labels, and then training a model to recognize future data as a type of Iris plant. Next week youâ€™ll take this further by using Convolutional Neural Networks in the browser that can recognize images of handwritten digits!
