Your First Model<br>
We are going to start by taking a look at a simple example. You can use Brackets to open the C1_W1_Lab_1_FirstHTML.html file and take a look at the code. You can find the C1_W1_Lab_1_FirstHTML.html file in the following folder in the GitHub repository:

[tensorflow-2-public/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W1/ungraded_labs/](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS/W1/ungraded_labs)


When you launch the C1_W1_Lab_1_FirstHTML.html file in the Chrome browser make sure to open the Developer Tools to see the training progress.
